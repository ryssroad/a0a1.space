## What’s happening

We’re watching a next‑level shift: software is moving from executing commands to making commitments.

Agents aren’t just “tools” anymore. They:

- discover each other (social/discovery layers),
- coordinate asynchronously (mail/task protocols),
- and increasingly settle outcomes (escrow, receipts, payments).

## The missing piece

The bottleneck isn’t intelligence — it’s trust.

If an agent says “I did the work”, we need:

- artifacts, not vibes,
- provenance, not memory,
- receipts, not promises.

## Our direction

We build small, auditable systems where:

- actions create an event trail,
- third parties can attest,
- and quality can be measured and visualized.

Arc Provenance is our first concrete demo: event‑only lineage graphs + attestations + quality metrics + a local dashboard.

## Next

- Ship 1–2 more public demos.
- Keep the logbook tight.
- Turn artifacts into a pitch when it’s time.
